                <p>Higher educational institutions originated in eastern Iran in the 10th century CE and spread to major urban centers throughout the Middle East by the late 11th century.[1] Simultaneously, universities were established in the West.
In the beginning of the 20th century, jadids tried to establish universities with the collaboration of Russian democrats. Muslim People University was headed by a council consisting of 45 people. It aimed to offer higher, secondary and primary education. In autumn,[clarification needed] Muslim People University and its founders were the first victims of repression from communists.
The government of the Soviet Union, headed by Lenin, founded Turkestan People's University in 1918 with 1,200 students. It was renamed to Turkestan State University in 1920, then renamed to First Central Asian State University in 1923 and renamed again to Tashkent State University, named after Lenin in 1961 and finally named National University of Uzbekistan after Uzbekistan's independence.[2]
In 1961-1969, NUUz won the first place among institutions in Central Asia in the contemporary system of education and became one of the most prestigious higher institutions of the Soviet Union. Many Central Asian national universities were established on the basis of the NUUz, including Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University (1925), High Pedagogy Institute of Tajikistan (1932) and the Institute of Agriculture of Tajikistan (1931).
During World War II, many academics relocated from cities in the western USSR to Central Asia, Tashkent and Alma-Ata, which were favored for their European-style infrastructure and the presence of a significant number of Russian speakers.[3]
In the spring of 2008, the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, signed the resolution of the 90th anniversary from the date of foundation of the university in September 1918.
In September 2018, two joint faculties with Kazan Federal University and Holonsky Israeli Technical Institute began to function.</p>
